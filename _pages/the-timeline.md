## Builds

### Build 0.1 (3/7/2023 - 3/19/2023)

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

</div>

<p style="flex-grow: 1;">This road map was part of the game for a while. Initially going to be one of 7 different maps. A different one per day. Unfortunately, due to poor time management from one of our members, we were unable to follow up on this plan. This led to this map turning into more of a stand-in for much of the development time. However, this resulted in a paradigm shift with our approach to the map. Thus leading to our current one.</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <p style="flex-grow: 1;">Oops. Game Over!</p>
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/oldgamesample2.png" alt="test" style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
</div>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/oldupgradeshop.png" alt="test" style="width: 1000px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
 </div>
<p style="flex-grow: 1;">Unlike the map from this build, the shop UI has some of the same aspects and features we're familiar with in the current build We just thought it was neat enough to keep the same and never really thought it needed much more, although change is inevitable and as we'll see later in the timeline, the shop was not exempt from this fact. It did, however, become increasingly more in depth with all the new items and such that would be added.</p>

### Build 0.5 (3/19/2023 - 4/5/2023)

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/gamesample1.png" alt="test" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/gamesample2.png" alt="test" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
 </div>
 <br>
 <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/gamesample3.png" alt="test" style="width: 1000px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
 </div>
 
 <p style="flex-grow: 1;"> The item rework basically overhauled the game. The previous build was very bland and unnuanced. Progression was seen in nothing but higher damage numbers and further knockback. Nothing visually gripping. However with the introduction of 9 new items and the scrapping of the old system, Answer For The Dust found itself reinvented. With the items came new UI and sprites. The red circles now more accurately depicted the player's life as they were now hearts and not...just...generic red circles. The rest of the UI was similarly added onto to to make it more colorful and attractive to the player.
  </p>
 
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/upgradeshop.png" alt="test" style="width: 1000px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
 </div>
<p style="flex-grow: 1;">The game shop by this point has been reworked almost entirely. The guns from build 0.1 were kept but access to them has been changed. Rather than being able to choose any of them at any time of entering the shop, the guns, as well as the upgrades were available for purchase by random chance. We dropped the generic statistic/weapon upgrades in favor of something more dynamic and visually fun with the various items. By this point, we had also planned on reworking the economy a little bit but in this build, it's not too dissimilar to the previous one.</p>

### Build 1.0 (4/5/2023 - Now)

<p style="flex-grow: 1;">The official launch build! It was a long few months but the crew finally crunched it up and were able to get the game to where it is now. The map is entirely different in that it's just one large never-ending sandbox. There are over 25 unique items in the game. The economy has been overhauled to be much more forgiving. The waves are now time based rather than a set amount of zombies every wave. With the new currencies came out of game currency with the moon coins. The sprites were redone to fit a more cohesive color pallet. Not only are there much more items, there are over twice as much guns! The UI has also been overhauled. Everything redesigned and recolored to fit the purple aesthetic. The items now provide item descriptions before purchase and actual effects after purchase. With every new build seems to come massive changes!</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/perkstore.png" alt="test" style="width: 350px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
  <img src="/AnswerForTheDust/assets/images/shop.png" alt="test" style="width: 350px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;">
 </div>
<p style="flex-grow: 1;">Moon coins and the perk shop were added in due to overwhelming requests from playtesters. They felt that it would be best to incentivize replayability even more by providing boons to players who stick out with the game for an extended sitting. Killing zombies earns the player the chance to pick up moon coins from their re-deceased corpses. Coins that can only be used on new runs, but allow for a much stronger start on subsequent ones. The shop is now stocked with over 3 times as many unique items for players to pick up and experiment with in further runs. In addition to those items, we welcome a wide variety of new guns! Even though the contents and UI of the shop have changed over the builds, we've tried to keep it feeling very similar to the very first inception of the shop.
