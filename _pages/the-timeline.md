## Builds

### Build 0.1 (3/7/2023 - 3/19/2023)

<p style="flex-grow: 1;">This road map was part of the game for a while. Initially going to be one of 7 different maps. A different one per day. Unfortunately, due to poor time management from one of our members, we were unable to follow up on this plan. This led to this map turning into more of a stand-in for much of the development time. However, this resulted in a paradigm shift with our approach to the map. Thus leading to our current one.</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <p style="flex-grow: 1;">Oops. Game Over!</p>

<p style="flex-grow: 1;">Unlike the map from this build, the shop UI has some of the same aspects and features we're familiar with in the current build We just thought it was neat enough to keep the same and never really thought it needed much more, although change is inevitable and as we'll see later in the timeline, the shop was not exempt from this fact. It did, however, become increasingly more in depth with all the new items and such that would be added.</p>

### Build 0.5 (3/19/2023 - 4/5/2023)

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

 </div>
 
 <p style="flex-grow: 1;"> The item rework basically overhauled the game. The previous build was very bland and unnuanced. Progression was seen in nothing but higher damage numbers and further knockback. Nothing visually gripping. However with the introduction of 9 new items and the scrapping of the old system, Answer For The Dust found itself reinvented. With the items came new UI and sprites. The red circles now more accurately depicted the player's life as they were now hearts and not...just...generic red circles. The rest of the UI was similarly added onto to to make it more colorful and attractive to the player.

 </div>
<p style="flex-grow: 1;">The game shop by this point has been reworked almost entirely. The guns from build 0.1 were kept but access to them has been changed. Rather than being able to choose any of them at any time of entering the shop, the guns, as well as the upgrades were available for purchase by random chance. We dropped the generic statistic/weapon upgrades in favor of something more dynamic and visually fun with the various items. By this point, we had also planned on reworking the economy a little bit but in this build, it's not too dissimilar to the previous one.</p>
