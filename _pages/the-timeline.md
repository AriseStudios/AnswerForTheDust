<p style="flex-grow: 1;">This road map was part of the game for a while. Initially going to be one of 7 different maps. A different one per day. Unfortunately, due to poor time management from one of our members, we were unable to follow up on this plan. This led to this map turning into more of a stand-in for much of the development time. However, this resulted in a paradigm shift with our approach to the map. Thus leading to our current one.</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <p style="flex-grow: 1;">Oops. Game Over!</p>

<p style="flex-grow: 1;">Unlike the map from this build, the shop UI has stayed relatively the same! We just thought it was neat enough to keep the same and never really thought it needed much more. It did, however, become increasingly more in depth with all the new items and such that would be added.</p>
