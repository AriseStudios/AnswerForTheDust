The user interface (UI) is a crucial part of any video game, and this is especially true for survivor-like zombie games. The UI needs to be intuitive and easy to use, providing players with the information they need to stay alive in a world overrun by the undead. Key elements to look for in a zombie game UI include health and stamina bars, inventory systems, maps and compasses, objective trackers, and weapon and ammo counters. Games like The Last of Us and State of Decay have UIs that do an excellent job of balancing complexity and usability, while other games like DayZ can be a bit clunky and difficult to navigate. A well-designed UI can make all the difference when it comes to surviving the apocalypse. 

We had to balance functionality with aesthetics. It's important to make sure players can quickly and easily access the information they need, but the UI also needs to fit with the game's overall aesthetic and mood. We spent a lot of time testing different designs and layouts to find the right balance between usability and immersion. In the end, we settled on a minimalist design that was easy to use but also conveyed the game's gritty, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Seeing players use and appreciate the UI we worked so hard on is incredibly rewarding, and we hope it adds to the overall gameplay experience.
