The item shop is one of the major parts of the gameplay loop. As of now there are 29 items in the game. Items range from simply increasing reload speed to adding a rhythm mechanic. We tried to make items feel unique from each other so that they’re fun and interesting. You’ll notice that many of the items are references. When looking at an item in the shop you’ll notice that they won’t tell you exactly what they do. The shop was designed this way to build intrigue of properties of items. We hope that the natural curiosity of players will encourage them to buy new items and try them out. We are currently in the works of balancing these items to make them feel worth their price. Expect the prices and the strength of their effects of these items to change as development continues. We also plan to add more items. Behind the scenes the items are managed through a script that tracks which items are equipped and their stats.
